1.	The objective of the project is to build an automated block coding kit using Machine Learning Algorithms.
2.	In the game, the block(s) with instructions are read Camera / Webcam. The actor on the screen is moved accordingly as per the instructions on the block.
3.	Module 1:  The instructions on the block(s) are recognized by the camera. 
4.	Using OCR the blocks are recognized and henceforth, the input for game is generated. 
5.	OCR process adopts the group of ML modules,easyOCR etc. 
6.	Blocks are identified using Text and Numbers in the block.
7.	Module 2: The recognized images are then used to simulate computer commands. 
8.	Based on the Commands, the actor proceeds further.
9.	Case study: Game is created with different grid sizes to evaluate the performance and the complexity.
